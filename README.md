# ros2-tank

First basic ROS project.

Got this thing: https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B0BNDQFRP1?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title

It comes with its own custom software but I am not using that. Instead going to take the hardware and try make a nice ROS2 project.

This is my first attempt at something in ROS2, so really don't expect this to be good!
